Large data file to use with ldassoc calculation:
/local/content/ldlink/data/assoc/meta_assoc.meta

username on server: ncianalysis
development server name nciws-d275-v

Most reasearchers get their data from a program called plink.
Two ways to list a positon on a genome.
1. The Chromosome method is chr#(1-22 or x or y):######(pos)
2. The direct index called rs number. rs#######
chr1:1 is equal to rs1
chr1:2 is equal to rs2

File upload max file size is set to 2 gig in the apache configuration file.

Two ajax calles:
1. Upload files /LDlinkRest/upload
2. Calculate /LDlinkRest/ldassoc
Gene names:
BRCA1
BRCA2
EWSR1
FLI1
BHLHE41
TP53

How ldAssoc works:

1. Set ldassocData global
2. Populates a jquery dataTable
3. Load a large datafile with multiple columns
4. Get column names from first line of file
5. Ask user to map column names to variables: chromosome, position, and p-value
6. Ask user what region: (region, gene, or variant)
7. Based on what the select for region they will be asked to fillout additonal variables.
8.  Select populations
9. Select D'(D prime) or R^2
10. Calculate
11. Display bokeh graph.  It is a python graphing that create javascript.  The javacript is then loaded and exectued on the page to create the graph.
12. Create links to data.
13. Poplate data into dataTable via ldassocData
