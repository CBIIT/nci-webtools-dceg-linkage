	<h3>Welcome to LDlink!</h3>
	<p>LDlink is a suite of web-based applications designed to
		easily and efficiently interrogate linkage disequilibrium in
		population groups. All population genotype data originates from
		Phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project and SNP rsnumbers are indexed
		based on dbSNP build 138. Only unambiguously mapping bi-allelic
		SNPs are permitted as input. LDlink includes the following
		components:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>LDhap</b>: Calculate population specific haplotype
			frequencies of all haplotypes observed for a list of query SNPs.
			Input is a list of SNP rsnumbers (one per line) and a population
			group.<br> <br></li>
		<li><b>LDheat</b>: Create interactive heat maps of pairwise
			linkage disequilibrium statistics. Input is a list of SNP
			rsnumbers (one per line) and a population group.<br> <br></li>
		<li><b>LDpair</b>: Investigate correlated alleles for SNPs in
			high LD. Input is two rsnumbers and a population group. <br>
			<br></li>
		<li><b>LDproxy</b>: Interactively explore proxy and putatively
			functional SNPs for a query SNP. Input is an rsnumber and a
			population group.<br> <br></li>
	</ul>
